# Miniproject: Solving VRPTW optimization problem using many Algorithms

This repository contains source code for many optimizing algorithms for **VRPTW** (Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows) such as: 

 * Exhaustive search: 
  * Backtracking
  * Branch and Bound 
 
 * Local search 
  * Hill Climbing 
 
 We have compared these algorithms using the 100 test cases generated by the script ```test_gen.py```. Our source codes using ```pandas``` to export the result into ```csv``` file for easily analysis
